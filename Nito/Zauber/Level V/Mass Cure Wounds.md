### Description

A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to **six creatures** in a **30-foot-radius sphere** centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to **3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier**. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

*At Higher Levels*: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
